<strong>[Chorus 1: Drake]</strong>
<div>
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
<div>

<div>
'Cause I want ya, and I nee/d ya
<div>

<strong>[Verse: Drake]</strong>
<div>
Look the new me is really still the real me
<div>
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
<div>
They gotta make some choices they runnin' out of options
<div>
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
<div>
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
<div>
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
<div>
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
<div>
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
<div>
TrapMoneyBenny
<div>

<div>
From the block like you Jenny
<div>
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many
</div>

<div>
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
<div>
And I'm down for you always
<div>
J.T., do you love me? Are you riding?
<div>
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
<div>
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
<div>
And I'm down for you always
</div>
</P>
